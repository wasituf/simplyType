# simplyType

A simple typing practice app that has a clean and minimal interface.

I have taken inspiration from popular typing websites like TypeRacer(https://play.typeracer.com/), 10FastFingers(https://10fastfingers.com/) and Monkytype(https://monkeytype.com/).

Currently:
The app shows results in words per minute (WPM), accuracy (%), and time (seconds)
The app has a virtual keyboard that shows user inputs with a click effect
The functionality of the settings menu is still in progress.
